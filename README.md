Welcome to the Password Generator App!

This is a simple app that allows you to generate strong and secure passwords that you can use for your online accounts. Here's how to use it:

Launch the app and choose your desired password length. You can choose a length between 10 and 64 characters.

Select the type of characters you want in your password. You can choose from lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Click on the "Generate Password" button and your new password will be displayed on the screen.

You can copy the generated password to your clipboard and use it to secure your online accounts.

If you're not happy with the generated password, you can click on the "Generate Password" button again to generate a new password.

Remember to never share your passwords with anyone, and to change them regularly to ensure the security of your accounts.

Thank you for using the Password Generator App!
